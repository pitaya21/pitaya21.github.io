<Td>       
<p>
 <H3><font color="white">We must have a knowledge about the limits since,
despite the fact that technology has been a good and significant advance for the human being,
it brought with it a series of problems of which we must be aware since they can harm our life.
One of the problems is: Addiction to the internet, this addiction is bad and serious since every day we become more dependent on this,
this is because today everything is done using the internet, from socializing to paying bills.
The most common problems of internet addiction are: Decreased visual capacity, insomnia, social problems, etc.</font></H3>

<Table>
<tr><h2><font color="pink">Do you think that technology improves or inhibits our knowledge tools and skills? Why?</font></h2>
<td>
<p>
<H3><font color="white">Both, because technology improves our knowledge tools in the sense that it gives us more facility to access information,
also provides us with a wide variety of information, helps our memory and if we have any doubts about something that eventually We were forgetting,
the technology with the use of the internet, helps to clarify that doubt, among many other things.
But it prevents us from improving our knowledge skills since nowadays, in the case of many students,
they no longer try hard to do things but they immediately take up the internet to get out of the way,
and that makes them very dependent Of the internet since they are not really learning.</font></H3>

<tr><h2><font color="pink">Symbol the advantage or disadvantage of the technology</font></h2>

<p>
<H3><font color="white">We chose this symbol because it represents how we are becoming so dependent on technology,
and if we continue this way, it will no longer be a resource but rather a fundamental necessity. </font></H3>
